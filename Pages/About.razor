    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        YANS is the simplest way to keep notes. Light, clean, and free. <br>
        Saving Notes are a great way for you to make some brief notes on a topic you are studying or working on, or if you want to quickly save a link you can use this web app to store it as a note. Whereas
        you would make longer more detailed notes in a workbook, sticky notes are great for writing down key words or
        phrases that you want to learn.
