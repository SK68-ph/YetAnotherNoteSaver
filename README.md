# YetAnotherNoteSaver

A simple app to keep notes.
Saving Notes are a great way for you to make some brief notes on a topic you are studying or working on, or if you want to quickly save a link you can use this web app to store it as a note. Whereas you would make longer more detailed notes in a workbook, sticky notes are great for writing down key words or phrases that you want to learn.
